    Trouble when building ?
  </summary>
  If you find one or more module loss, the most possible reason is that the ROM organization do not contain it. You could search it on it's related Github profile
<pre><code>
  name: "vendor_vibrator_hal"
</code></pre>
As you find it, copy and paste the hal as well as its defaults code paragraph in "{}" in the related file who occours error, in the most cases, Android.bp

Re-run lunch to see whether error fixed. Once it compelete, you could use aosp-setup to autobuild.
